%%Discription: in this example, we consider a simple gene expression system
%%that has four species inactivated gene (S1), activated gene (S2), and the
%%mRNA (S3), and the protein (S4).There are four reactions involved:
%%S1-->S2, S2-->S1, S2-->S2+S3, S3-->S3+S4, S3-->0, S4-->0. The gene
%%product can be measured by a fluorescent microscope, where
%%h(x)=10*min(x(4),100).
